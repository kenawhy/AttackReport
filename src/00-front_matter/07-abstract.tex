	This thesis examines the development of a PowerShell-based Command and Control (C2) framework integrating keystroke injection techniques inspired by the Rubber Ducky concept for cyber-attack simulation. The framework is designed to send automated commands from the C2 server to target devices, enabling realistic simulation of command injection-based attacks in security testing. This research uses an experimental approach with a descriptive design to evaluate the effectiveness of the framework in evading detection by various security systems.
